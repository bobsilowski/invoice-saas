        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: April 06, 2025</p>
        <p>Welcome to InvoiceAI. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our invoicing service.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following information when you use our service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Your name, phone number, and email address, which you provide when filling out the invoicing form.</li>
            <li><strong>Invoice Data:</strong> Details such as client name, due date, billable items, and bank details (if provided) to generate your invoice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use your information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generate and provide you with invoices in PDF format.</li>
            <li>Contact you if you’ve provided an email address, for example, to notify you of updates or issues with your invoice.</li>
            <li>Improve our service by analyzing usage patterns (anonymized data only).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored securely on Netlify’s servers when you submit the form. We do not store your invoice data on our servers after the PDF is generated; it is stored locally in your browser’s memory and cleared when you refresh the page. We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data, but no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>

            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>

            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can request that we delete your data (note: we do not store your data after the session ends).</li>
            <li><strong>Objection:</strong> You can object to the processing of your data.</li>
